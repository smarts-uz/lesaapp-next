I'll help you set up Prisma in your project. First, let's create the necessary Prisma initialization files and configuration.

First, I'll create the Prisma schema file and set up the basic configuration.

---

```diff
+ // This is your Prisma schema file,
+ // learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema
+ 
  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }
  
  datasource db {
-   provider = "mysql"
+   provider = "postgresql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  }
```

---

Now, I'll create the Prisma client instance file that we'll use throughout the application.

---

```diff
- 
+ import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
+ 
+ const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
+   prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
+ }
+ 
+ export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient()
+ 
+ if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
+   globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
+ }
+ 
```

---

Now, let's create a `.env` file to store your database connection URL.
