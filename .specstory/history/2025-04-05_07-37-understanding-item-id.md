In the WooCommerce refund context shown in this code, `itemId` refers to the unique identifier (primary key) of a specific line item in an order from the `wp_woocommerce_order_items` table. 

It's different from `productId`:
- `itemId` identifies a specific instance of a product in a particular order
- `productId` identifies the product itself in the catalog

When processing refunds, the system needs both:
- The `itemId` to reference and update the specific order line item
- The `productId` to adjust inventory and identify which product is being refunded

The code uses `itemId` to mark original items as restocked, update meta information, and associate refund line items with their original order items.
