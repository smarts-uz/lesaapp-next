I'll help you create a more descriptive and SEO-friendly description for your Lesa POS application. I'll edit the metadata description in the layout file to better represent what the application does.

Let me update the description in `app/layout.tsx`:

---

```diff
  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: "Lesa POS",
-   description: "Lesa POS",
+   description: "Modern point-of-sale system for efficient business management. Streamline sales, inventory, and customer relationships with our intuitive POS solution.",
  }

```

---

I've updated the description to be more comprehensive and informative. The new description:

1. Clearly states what the application is (a point-of-sale system)
2. Highlights key features (sales, inventory, customer relationships)
3. Emphasizes the modern and intuitive nature of the solution
4. Uses relevant keywords for SEO purposes

This description will be more helpful for both users and search engines to understand what Lesa POS offers. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this description?
