How to create a cursor rule in .cursor folder for specific tech

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you create a cursor rule for specific technology. First, I'll check if there's a `.cursor` directory in your workspace.

I see you have a `.cursor` directory. Let me check its contents to see what rules already exist.

To create a cursor rule for a specific technology, you need to:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `.cursor/rules` directory with your rule configuration
2. The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Rule Name",
  "description": "Description of what this rule does",
  "pattern": "**/*.{ext1,ext2}",  // File patterns to match
  "rules": {
    "your-rule-id": {
      "severity": "warning|error",
      "message": "Your rule message",
      "regex": "your-regex-pattern"
    }
  }
}
```

For example, if you want to create a rule for TypeScript files that enforces a specific naming convention, you would create a file like `typescript-naming.json` in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

Would you like me to create a specific rule for your technology? Please let me know:
1. Which technology you want to create rules for
2. What specific patterns or conventions you want to enforce

create a sample rule

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a sample rule for TypeScript that enforces consistent function naming conventions (camelCase for functions).




---

```diff
- 
+ {
+   "name": "TypeScript Function Naming Convention",
+   "description": "Enforces camelCase naming for functions in TypeScript files",
+   "pattern": "**/*.ts",
+   "rules": {
+     "function-naming": {
+       "severity": "warning",
+       "message": "Function names should use camelCase",
+       "regex": "function\\s+[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\\s*\\("
+     }
+   }
+ } 
```

---

I've created a sample rule that:
- Applies to all TypeScript files (`**/*.ts`)
- Checks for function declarations
- Ensures they start with lowercase (camelCase)
- Shows a warning if the convention is violated

The rule will match function declarations like:
- ✅ `function myFunction()`
- ❌ `function MyFunction()`

You can create similar rules for other patterns by:
1. Changing the `pattern` to match different file types
2. Modifying the `regex` to match different code patterns
3. Adjusting `severity` to "error" for stricter enforcement

what about .cursorrules format?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me create a sample rule using the `.cursorrules` format, which is an alternative format that uses a more concise syntax.



---

```diff
- 
+ # TypeScript conventions
+ *.ts {
+     # Function naming convention
+     function\s+[A-Z] {
+         severity: warning
+         message: "Function names should use camelCase"
+     }
+     
+     # No console.log in production
+     console\.log {
+         severity: error
+         message: "Avoid console.log in production code"
+     }
+ } 
```

---

The `.cursorrules` format is more concise and uses:
- File patterns with `*.ts`
- Block syntax with `{}`
- Comments with `#`
- Simpler key-value pairs
- Multiple rules in one file

This format is easier to read and maintain compared to the JSON format.
