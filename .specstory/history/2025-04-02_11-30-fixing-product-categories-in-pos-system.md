Fix categories, let them take it from products

I'll help you fix the categories in the POS client component. Currently, the code is extracting categories from product names, but it would be better to use the actual category data from the products.

Let me first check the Product type to understand how categories are structured in the products data.

Now I understand the issue. The current implementation is extracting categories from product names, but the products already have a `categories` array property. Let's fix the POS client component to use the actual categories from the products.

I'll edit the `pos-client.tsx` file to extract unique categories from the products' categories arrays instead of inferring them from product names:

---

```diff

  export function POSClient({ products }: POSClientProps) {
-   // Extract unique categories from product names
+   // Extract unique categories from product categories arrays
    const categories = Array.from(
      new Set(
-       products.map((product) =>
-         product.name.toLowerCase().includes("scaffold")
-           ? "Scaffolding"
-           : "Safety"
-       )
+       products.flatMap((product) => product.categories)
      )
    );
```

---

Now I need to update the filtering logic to work with the new categories. Currently, it's filtering based on whether the product name includes the category name, but we should filter based on whether the product's categories array includes the selected category:

---

```diff
      if (activeCategory !== "all") {
        filtered = filtered.filter((product) =>
-         product.name.toLowerCase().includes(activeCategory.toLowerCase())
+         product.categories.includes(activeCategory)
        );
      }
```

---

Great! Now the POS client component will use the actual categories from the products instead of inferring them from product names. This change will make the category filtering more accurate and maintainable.

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Updated the categories extraction to use `flatMap` to get all unique categories from the products' categories arrays.
2. Modified the filtering logic to check if a product's categories array includes the selected category, rather than checking if the product name includes the category name.

These changes ensure that:

- All categories from the products are properly displayed in the tabs
- Products are correctly filtered when a category is selected
- The code is more maintainable as it uses the actual data structure rather than inferring categories from product names

The POS client will now correctly display and filter products based on their actual categories as defined in the product data.
