Let me help you understand and search for the relevant code to ensure the bundle product quantity in the cart modal matches the quantity in the `pos-cart-section.tsx`.

First, I'll search for related code to understand the bundle product handling:

Based on the search results, I can see that we need to synchronize the bundle quantity between the bundle customization dialog and the cart. Let me analyze the code flow:

1. When a bundle is added to cart, it's handled by `BundleCustomizationDialog` component
2. The bundle quantity is managed in the dialog using `bundleQuantity` state
3. When adding to cart, the quantity needs to be preserved

Let me make the necessary changes to ensure the bundle quantity in the modal matches the cart quantity:

---

```diff

        setCustomizedItems(initialItems);
+
+       // If editing an existing bundle in cart, set its quantity
+       if (product.quantity) {
+         setBundleQuantity(product.quantity);
+       }
      } else if (!open) {
        // Reset state when dialog is closed
```

---

I see the linter errors. The issue is that the `Product` type doesn't include the `quantity` property. We need to check if we're editing an existing bundle from the cart, which would have the quantity property. Let me fix this:

---

```diff

        // If editing an existing bundle in cart, set its quantity
-       if (product.quantity) {
+       if ('quantity' in product) {
          setBundleQuantity(product.quantity);
        }
```

---

I see the issue. We need to properly type check the quantity value before setting it:

---

```diff

        // If editing an existing bundle in cart, set its quantity
-       if ('quantity' in product) {
+       if ('quantity' in product && typeof product.quantity === 'number') {
          setBundleQuantity(product.quantity);
        }
```

Great! The changes have been made successfully. Here's what we've done to ensure the bundle product quantity in the cart modal matches the cart quantity:

1. When editing an existing bundle from the cart, we now initialize the `bundleQuantity` state in the `BundleCustomizationDialog` with the cart item's quantity.
2. We added proper type checking to ensure the quantity exists and is a number before setting it.
3. The existing `handleBundleQuantityChange` function already handles updating the bundle item quantities proportionally when the bundle quantity changes.

This means that:

1. When you open the bundle editor for an existing cart item, it will show the same quantity as in the cart
2. When you change the bundle quantity, it will proportionally update all the bundled items' quantities
3. When you save the changes, the updated quantities will be preserved in the cart

The synchronization between the cart and bundle editor should now work as expected.
